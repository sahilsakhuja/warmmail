Final Project, CSCI E-29 (Spring 2021)

Background
**********

With the objective of focusing on the advanced python aspects learnt in the course, I have picked a project which is less heavy on the data science side, but makes greater use of the course concepts themselves.

The Idea - Warm Mail: AQI updates as an email every day.

Do this
**********

A task typically follows conceptual information. Task titles should be imperative. Tasks should have a short introduction sentence that captures the user's goal and introduces the steps, for example, "Verify your products are in the catalog:"

A task should have 3 - 7 steps.  Tasks with more should be broken down into digestible chunks.

Intro sentence.

#. Step 1.

#. Step 2.

#. Step 3.

Following the steps, you should add the result and any follow-up tasks needed.
